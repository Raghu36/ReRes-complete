# ReRes-complete
Our project mainly focuses on the Image Resolution Enhancement using CNN and DCNN and also a the same time we provide an comparision between the regular interpolation techniques such as bilinear,bicubic,nearest neighbour with the CNN.
So far we have been able to achieve better resolution than the high resolution images thst we have considered.
